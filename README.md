## Week 8:

### Activity 1: Research a New Language

**What is the language used for? :**

The language that i chose for my research on is Haskell,
Haskell is a functional programming language primarily used for complex mathematical computations, data analysis, and building robust and efficient software. It is known for its strong type system, lazy evaluation, and elegant syntax, making it suitable for academic research and development of high-performance applications. Haskell is widely used in industries like finance, where mathematical precision is crucial, as well as in academia for teaching and research purposes.


**Who uses the language? :** 

Various organizations and companies utilize Haskell in their projects, including financial institutions like Standard Chartered and Barclays, as well as technology companies such as Facebook and GitHub. Haskell's unique features make it a preferred choice for applications that require correctness, reliability, and maintainability.


**What are some useful resources? :**

The Haskell programming language website: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) serves as a comprehensive hub for documentation, tutorials, and community support. The [Haskell Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) community is another useful platform for getting help, sharing experiences, and staying updated on Haskell-related developments. 


**Why are these specific resources useful?**

These resources are beneficial as they cater to different learning styles and levels of expertise, enabling individuals to grasp Haskell concepts and apply them effectively in their projects.

## Choose a language for community code

For the community code project, I am choosing one of the most widely utilized JavaScript frameworks, namely the Node.js, This framework is extensively employed for developing backend servers and managing APIs. Leveraging my prior experience with JavaScript in a scholastic context, I believe that delving into the Node.js framework is an optimal choice for advancing my research and enhancing my proficiency in backend technologies.

## Write a user story:

### App Example: **TaskPro**

### Description:
TaskPro is a powerful and user-friendly task management app designed for seamless organization and productivity. Create, customize, and prioritize tasks with ease, set due dates, and categorize tasks into distinct projects. Receive timely notifications, collaborate with team members, and stay on top of your schedule with an intuitive visual calendar. TaskPro simplifies task management, making it your essential companion for efficient and effective productivity.


### Specific User Stories:

* In my user experience, I would like to append a new task, specifying its title and description.
* I want to assign due dates to my tasks as part of my task management routine.
* The ability to categorize tasks into distinct lists or projects is essential for my organizational needs.
* Implementing a feature where I can mark tasks as complete aligns with my task tracking preferences.
* It is important for me to receive notifications or reminders for impending tasks to stay on top of my schedule.
* Attaching files or notes to tasks for additional context is a feature I find valuable in managing my workload.
* Prioritizing tasks for distinguishing their significance is a functionality I seek.
* Having a search and filter option based on keywords or categories is crucial for efficient task retrieval.
* Visualizing tasks on a calendar displaying due dates would be a beneficial addition to the app.
* Collaborative task capabilities with team members is a desirable feature for group projects or shared responsibilities.

  
### Acceptance Criteria for Adding a New Task:

* A conspicuous 'Add New Task' button should be readily accessible within the application.
* When adding a task, there should be clearly defined fields for title, description, and due date.
* Upon successful task creation, the application should provide immediate feedback.
* Newly created tasks should promptly appear in the task list for seamless task tracking.
* Users should have the flexibility to edit or delete tasks post-creation.
* The application should support a quick-add feature enabling task addition without navigating away from the current view.

  
### Acceptance Criteria for Task Notification:
* Users should consistently receive timely notifications as tasks approach their due dates.
* Notification content must include task title and due date for effective reminders.
* Users should be empowered to snooze or dismiss notifications based on their preferences.
* The application should adhere to user-specified notification settings, such as sound and vibration preferences.
