## Activity 1: Research a New Language

**What is the language used for? :**

The language that i chose for my research on is Haskell,
Haskell is a functional programming language primarily used for complex mathematical computations, data analysis, and building robust and efficient software. It is known for its strong type system, lazy evaluation, and elegant syntax, making it suitable for academic research and development of high-performance applications. Haskell is widely used in industries like finance, where mathematical precision is crucial, as well as in academia for teaching and research purposes.


**Who uses the language? :** 

Various organizations and companies utilize Haskell in their projects, including financial institutions like Standard Chartered and Barclays, as well as technology companies such as Facebook and GitHub. Haskell's unique features make it a preferred choice for applications that require correctness, reliability, and maintainability.


**What are some useful resources? :**

*  **[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)** : The Haskell programming language website:  serves as a comprehensive hub for documentation, tutorials, and community support.
*  **[Haskell Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/)** : This community is another useful platform for getting help, sharing experiences, and staying updated on Haskell-related developments.
*  **[Haskell for Mac](http://learn.hfm.io/)** : Haskell for Mac offers a comprehensive and step-by-step learning experience for Haskell, covering foundational aspects like basic syntax and recursion, progressing to higher-order functions and algebraic data types.


**Why are these specific resources useful?**

These Haskell learning resources collectively provide a well-rounded approach to mastering the language. The official [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) website serves as a centralized repository for authoritative documentation and tutorials, offering foundational knowledge. The [Haskell Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) community provides a dynamic platform for interactive learning, where users can seek assistance, share experiences, and stay informed about the latest developments. Notably, [Haskell for Mac](http://learn.hfm.io/) stands out for its Mac-specific, step-by-step learning experience, covering fundamental syntax, recursion, and progressing to advanced topics like higher-order functions and algebraic data types, making it an invaluable resource for those seeking a structured and hands-on approach to Haskell mastery.

## Activity 2: Choose a language for community code

For the community code project, I am choosing one of the most widely utilized JavaScript frameworks, namely the Node.js, This framework is extensively employed for developing backend servers and managing APIs. Leveraging my prior experience with JavaScript in a scholastic context, I believe that delving into the Node.js framework is an optimal choice for advancing my research and enhancing my proficiency in backend technologies.

## Activity 3: Write a user story:

### App Example: **TaskPro**

### Description:
TaskPro is a powerful and user-friendly task management app designed for seamless organization and productivity. Create, customize, and prioritize tasks with ease, set due dates, and categorize tasks into distinct projects. Receive timely notifications, collaborate with team members, and stay on top of your schedule with an intuitive visual calendar. TaskPro simplifies task management, making it your essential companion for efficient and effective productivity.


### Specific User Stories:

* In my user experience, I would like to append a new task, specifying its title and description.
* I want to assign due dates to my tasks as part of my task management routine.
* The ability to categorize tasks into distinct lists or projects is essential for my organizational needs.
* Implementing a feature where I can mark tasks as complete aligns with my task tracking preferences.
* It is important for me to receive notifications or reminders for impending tasks to stay on top of my schedule.
* Attaching files or notes to tasks for additional context is a feature I find valuable in managing my workload.
* Prioritizing tasks for distinguishing their significance is a functionality I seek.
* Having a search and filter option based on keywords or categories is crucial for efficient task retrieval.
* Visualizing tasks on a calendar displaying due dates would be a beneficial addition to the app.
* Collaborative task capabilities with team members is a desirable feature for group projects or shared responsibilities.

  
### Acceptance Criteria for Adding a New Task:

* A conspicuous 'Add New Task' button should be readily accessible within the application.
* When adding a task, there should be clearly defined fields for title, description, and due date.
* Upon successful task creation, the application should provide immediate feedback.
* Newly created tasks should promptly appear in the task list for seamless task tracking.
* Users should have the flexibility to edit or delete tasks post-creation.
* The application should support a quick-add feature enabling task addition without navigating away from the current view.

  
### Acceptance Criteria for Task Notification:
* Users should consistently receive timely notifications as tasks approach their due dates.
* Notification content must include task title and due date for effective reminders.
* Users should be empowered to snooze or dismiss notifications based on their preferences.
* The application should adhere to user-specified notification settings, such as sound and vibration preferences.

## Activity 4 - Star Github topics repositories of interest

**Reflections:**
During the GitHub exploration activity, I delved into the diverse landscape of open-source communities, repositories, and topics. Navigating through the Explore, Topics, Trending, and Collections tabs, I meticulously starred repositories and topics that piqued my interest. This process not only broadened my understanding of the vast array of projects but also provided valuable insights into trending technologies and curated collections. The outcome of this activity is a personalized collection of starred repositories and topics, serving as a curated roadmap for potential areas of contribution and learning. As I revisited the Explore tab after starring items, I observed a refreshing mix of content, showcasing the immediate impact of my exploration. Overall, this activity has equipped me with a rich set of resources and insights that will undoubtedly guide my involvement in the upcoming Community Code project.

## Activity 1: Read the Community Code Assignment

The assignment has two main goals: promoting good coding practices and contributing to open-source communities. It's split into two parts, and although both need completion, you only have to contribute code to one of them. The two parts are meant to be worked on simultaneously, not sequentially.

**Part 1** : involves finding and contributing to a real open-source community. Contributions can range from improving code documentation to answering community questions or even creating tutorials. The outcome should be a well-defined contribution, which you can choose to share or keep private. The preparation involves forking a project, creating a development branch, making changes, and undergoing a code review. Detailed documentation about the open-source project, links to your fork, issues examined, and the code review process is required in your Research and Reflection Journal.

**Part 2** : is about contributing to a custom open-source project, specifically the DGL 104 pattern library repository. This part requires creating code resources for future students, implementing design and architecture patterns, and following open-source project practices. All contributions should be made through pull requests, and work should be tracked via issues. Logging all work in your Research and Reflection Journal, including a final reflection, is crucial for your contributions to count. The time commitment for this assignment is significant, with an expected contribution of around 16 hours over the assignment's duration. Overall, the assignment is designed to provide practical experience in open-source contribution, emphasizing real-world projects and community engagement while adhering to industry standards.
