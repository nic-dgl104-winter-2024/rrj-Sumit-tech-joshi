# Research and Reflection Journal

This Research and Reflection Journal will contain all required and recommended activities in DGL 104 from week 8 through to the end of the semester.



## Week 8:

### Activity 1: Research a New Language

**What is the language used for? :**
The language that i chose for my research on is Haskell,
Haskell is a functional programming language primarily used for complex mathematical computations, data analysis, and building robust and efficient software. It is known for its strong type system, lazy evaluation, and elegant syntax, making it suitable for academic research and development of high-performance applications. Haskell is widely used in industries like finance, where mathematical precision is crucial, as well as in academia for teaching and research purposes.


**Who uses the language? :** 
Various organizations and companies utilize Haskell in their projects, including financial institutions like Standard Chartered and Barclays, as well as technology companies such as Facebook and GitHub. Haskell's unique features make it a preferred choice for applications that require correctness, reliability, and maintainability.


**What are some useful resources? :**
The Haskell programming language website: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) serves as a comprehensive hub for documentation, tutorials, and community support. The [Haskell Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) community is another useful platform for getting help, sharing experiences, and staying updated on Haskell-related developments. 


**Why are these specific resources useful?**
These resources are beneficial as they cater to different learning styles and levels of expertise, enabling individuals to grasp Haskell concepts and apply them effectively in their projects.
